# STAC Packages

The [stactools-packages](https://github.com/stactools-packages/) github organization is a home for datasets and tool packages using the
[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec) specification.

Please use the template described below to add your data and tools.

## Adding a new Package

Clone the [template repository](https://github.com/stactools-packages/template) as your package name, e.g. `landsat`.
This name should be short, memorable, and a valid Python package name.
It can include a hyphen, in which case the name for Python imports will be the underscored version, e.g. `landsat-8` goes to `stactools.landsat_8`.
Your name will be used on PyPI to publish the package in the stactools namespace, e.g. `stactools-landsat`.

To learn about how to create a STAC, first read the [Best Practices document](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-spec/blob/master/best-practices.md#stac-best-practices) 
to get a sense of what has emerged from other people using the specification. 


[STAC extensions](https://github.com/stac-extensions/) may have additional methods to describe your data and are **STRONGLY** encouraged.

## List of STAC Packages
